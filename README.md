## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Add new todos to the list
- Mark todos as complete
- Delete todos from the list
- Filter by all/active/complete todos
- Clear all completed todos
- Toggle light and dark mode
- See flash messages during CRUD operations.

Updates that I plan to implement in the future:

- **Bonus**: Drag and drop to reorder items on the list
- Save active filter in local storage
- User registration
- Smooth transitions when adding or removing items
- Better looking confirmation modals on delete action
